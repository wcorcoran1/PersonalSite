        This project is a place that I would love to visit in the future.
    I have always been facsinated with English history and culture. I think that it comes from my grandma who is big in all things British. I would love to visit England to experence some of my ancestoral homelands.

    <h3 class="project-2">Project Two</h3>
    <p class="project-2">
        The next place that I would like to visit is Japan. I think it would be cool to see Tokyo and ride the bullet train to Kyoto. Japan has always been a facsinating place to me.

    <h3 class="project-3">Project Three</h3>
    <p class="project-3">
        <img class="denver" src="maxresdefault.jpeg" alt="Denver with Rock Mountains">
        The next place that I would like to visit is Denver, Colorado. I would be able to go see the Rocky Mountains and see a beautiful city.
        Another reason that I want to go to Denver is to take my dad to a Broncos game at Mile Stadium. My dad is a huge Broncos fan because of John Elway.
